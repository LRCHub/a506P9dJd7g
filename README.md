[00:59.79] She says you've given up.
[01:01.26] Your folks told me you should be left alone
[01:04.18] On a mountaintop,
[01:05.77] Knocking the aeroplanes down with stones.
[01:08.12] Do the whirlwind and carry the hope that stings all night long.
[01:12.12] Don't abandom him, 'cause he quivers when he hears your song.
[01:42.62] 
[01:50.97] Believe me, it's safe to see.
[01:52.86] At least be confused about right and wrong.
[01:55.74] Plan to settle down
[01:57.26] Over the moon under the sun.
[01:59.81] Do the whirlwind and shotgun the seat that beat, that beats,
[02:03.76] Hanging on to the one you love,
[02:05.88] To keep keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on.
[02:25.38] 
[02:42.96] Folks given up under the quivers and lines.
[02:46.45] You do the whirlwind, don't abandon.
[02:48.63] Get a handle of yourself, son.
[02:51.04] Folks given up under the quivers and lines.
[02:54.70] You do the whirlwind, don't abandon.
[02:57.28] Get a handle of yourself, son.

[03:20.46] You do the whirlwind, don't abandon. (Do the whirlwind)
[03:23.22] Get a handle of yourself, son.
